Ingredients
-Peanutbutter
-Jelly (your choice, though I do recommend trying apple)
-bread, 2 slices
Directions
1.  Put heaping mounds of jelly on one slice of bread and spread evenly.
2.  Put heaping mounds of peanut butter on the other slice of bread and spread evenly
Note: the ratio of peanut butter to jelly is a culinary dispute dating back before the French revolution.  It is highly recommended that you expirement with this ratio until you reach a desired taste and texture.
3.  Place the two slice of bread together with the jelly and peanut butter sides facing.
